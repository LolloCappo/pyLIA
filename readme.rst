Lock-In Analyzer
-------------------------
This module allows to compute magnitude and phase from thermal images implementing a lock-in digital analyzer.
Peak amplitude and phase are obtained from thermal image sequence.
We developed this module while working on images recorded from FLIR thermal camera.
